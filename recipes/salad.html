    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="re-p">Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce – fruits and veggies that are so good on their own that you don’t need to do much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our dinner table with a big, colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Crunchy green and red cabbage</li>
        <li>Charred peppers</li>
        <li>Green onions, cilantro, mint & basil</li>
        <li>Peaches</li>
        <li>Seeds or nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the cashew butter, miso paste, lime juice, sesame oil, and ginger. Whisk in enough water to create a drizzable consistency. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a dry cast-iron skillet over medium heat, char the peppers whole, rotating until the edges have a little char, about 2 minutes per side. Remove. When cool to the touch, slice in half lengthwise, remove the stem, ribbing, and seeds and slice horizontally into thin strips.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, peppers, scallions, cilantro, basil, chiles, and ¾ of the dressing. Toss until combined. Add the remaining dressing, if desired, and season to taste with a few pinches of sea salt. Serve topped with the toasted nuts, seeds, and sliced peaches.</li>
    </ol>
